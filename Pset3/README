Solutions to problems 1 through 3 are in pset3_soln.txt.

The file system ( problem 4 ) source is in filesytem folder.
The filesystem folders have two folders, one for source file (c source files) 
and one for header files ( c header files ). Please add these files in a 
codewarrior project to build and run it. There is no Makefile because this will 
build on Unix machines as it has ed and buttons dependencies. 

Please refer to Outline.pdf for design and documentation of this problem. 

I've implemented 'list' command for extra credit. it lists all the files in the
file system.
